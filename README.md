⚡ **Classes that take care of one specific task.**

This package introduces a new way of organising the logic of your Laravel applications by focusing on the actions your application provide.

Instead of creating controllers, jobs, listeners and so on, it allows you to create a PHP class that handles a specific task and run that class as anything you want.

Therefore it encourages you to switch your focus from:

> "What controllers do I need?", "should I make a FormRequest for this?", "should this run asynchronously in a job instead?", ect.

to:

> "What does my application actually do?"
